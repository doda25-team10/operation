# Team 10 Activity

## Week Q2.1 (Nov 10+)
No work

## Week Q2.2 (Nov 17+)

- **Andrea:** https://github.com/doda25-team10/model-service/pull/2
  I have worked on A1, covering the model service containerisation, versioning, and packaging, covering points F3, F4, F5, F6, and F8.

- **Yi:** https://github.com/doda25-team10/operation/pull/4 I worked on running the containers with documentation covering the steps to run it. This covers F7.


- **Maciej:** I did not contribute to this part of the Project the way I intended to due to late group joining, which was my fault, and some family related problems at the beginning of the course. However, I will fully commit to the project in the upcoming weeks to help my group achieve a desired goal.

- **Aadesh:**: I have worked on the containerisation, versioning and packaging of the app-service, i.e. F3, F4, F5, F6, F8. Not everything might be on main yet but it is implemented.
