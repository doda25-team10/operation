### Week Q2.2 (Nov 17+)

- **Andrea:** https://github.com/doda25-team10/model-service/pull/2
  I have worked on A1, covering the model service containerisation, versioning, and packaging, covering points F3, F4, F5, F6, and F8.

- **Yi:** https://github.com/doda25-team10/operation/pull/4 I worked on running the containers with documentation covering the steps to run it. This covers F7.

- **Paul:** https://github.com/doda25-team10/lib-version/pull/6
  I have worked on A1, implementing the version-aware library, its automated release workflow and the advanced versioning strategy for it, covering F1, F2 and F11.

- **Maciej:** I did not contribute to this part of the Project the way I intended to due to late group joining, which was my fault, and some family related problems at the beginning of the course. However, I will fully commit to the project in the upcoming weeks to help my group achieve a desired goal.
